3. Android/ iOS text msg issue ( block msg, icon missing )( add accept , block functionality)
>> Functionality issue and missing button in android... in android friend suggestion page click on any user to check user profile there should be text msg button/icon which is missing when we sent friends request then it’s appears. 
Issue: In iOS there is text button/icon when click on it it says user is blocked
Correct functionality is show button/icon and if user click on button able to send text
Add feature .. first time send msg receiver also get option accept or block ... also add block option in more so user can block any time
SOlution:
Backend API to check user is in friend list or not.
Backend API to check this user is in contact list or not based on that app side Block/Accept button will show.
Backend API to block any particular user who is not in friend list.
Changes in existing block/unblock user and load blocked user.
Screen change where we need to provide Block/Accept button.
